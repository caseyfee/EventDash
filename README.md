# EventDash

## Description

[EventDash](https://caseyfee.github.io/EventDash/) is a dynamic web search page that will help users discover nearby local events based on their radius input. The website also provides driving directions to the user's selected event.

# How to Use EventDash

Here are  step-by-step instructions for using the EventDash website features.

## How to Search for Events
1. Enter a radius in the text box (e.g., 10, 25, etc.) and click the 'Search' button. A list of events will populate below the search bar. Your browser may prompt you to allow location-sharing. Allow the browser to do so.
